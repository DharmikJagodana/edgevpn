## Sending and receiving files

EdgeVPN can be used to send and receive files between hosts via p2p with the  `file-send` and `file-receive` subcommand.

Sending and receiving files, as services, don't establish a VPN connection.

### Sending

```bash
$ edgevpn file-send --name unique-id --path /src/path
```

### Receiving

```bash
$ edgevpn file-receive --name unique-id --path /dst/path
```
